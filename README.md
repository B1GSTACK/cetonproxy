# cetonproxy
An app that allows a Ceton InfiniTV network tuner to appear as a SiliconDust HDHomeRun to DVR apps like NextPVR.

# Install
1. Download the latest release zip and extract to a folder.
2. Run cetonproxy.exe.
3. Fill in the IP to your ceton tuner device.
4. Click `Edit Channels` for it to request the channel list from the Ceton.
5. Click the checkmark next to the channels you wish to be accessible through the HDHomeRun service.  Holding `shift` while clicking checkmarks allows selecting them in bulk.
